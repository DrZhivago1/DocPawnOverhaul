The goal of this mod is to make pawns feel damage. I found inspiration in [VE-CO](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=30799.0) to overhaul the Vanilla combat in a mod-friendly way. The way in which this mod handles that are through these features:
- Increase pain and bleeding rates to Human pawns from most damage types (no more spongy flesh pawns)
- Pawns are less likely to lose small limbs
- Pawns are more likely to be shot in the torso
- Organs are critical wounds and more likely to be hit
- Medical aid will be more necessary in the field
- Animals are slightly more robust
- Bionics and Armor become far more important
- Completely save-friendly to add or remove as you wish

All races are effected by the bleeding and pain changes. This mod also effects races using Vanilla bodies (Humans and Animals) by changing their bodypart hit chances.
