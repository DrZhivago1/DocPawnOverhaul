The goal of this mod is to make pawns feel damage. I found inspiration in [VE-CO](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=30799.0) to overhaul the Vanilla combat in a mod-friendly way. The way in which this mod handles that are through these features:
- Increase pain and bleeding rates to Human pawns from most damage types
- Pawns are less spongy and bleed out faster
- Pawns are less likely to lose small limbs
- Pawns are more likely to be shot in the torso
- Organs are critical wounds and more likely to be hit
- Medical aid will be more necessary in the field
- Animals are slightly more robust
- Bionics and Armor become far more important
- Completely save-friendly to add or remove as you wish
